        <strong>1. BIRYANI</strong>
    </h2>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biryani" class="Biryani" target="_blank;">
    <img class="image" id="biryani" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ZQnxyO1JDbk9KRH-U5VB_KN2aVV-FQJdja_D7_nJvQcLQ4lG4_2RgtrqQoYH_H-TXui11wdFhqum_inYFBOI0JXbaObHnHQKTyVBh3taeFSz-Y5w3rSW6QE-6hu8ZL0L-IABil4YBKc7LHk" alt="Biryani" width="500px;"></a>
    <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 13px;">The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed in the Muslim centres of Delhi (Mughlai cuisine), Rampur, Lucknow (Awadhi cuisine) and other small principalities. In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad Deccan (where some believe the dish originated]) as well as Tamil Nadu (Ambur, Thanjavur, Chettinad, Salem, Dindigal), Kerala (Malabar), Telangana, and Karnataka (Bhatkal) where Muslim communities were present. 
        <br>According to historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526–1857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of India and the Persian pilaf. Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia, and was brought to India by the Mughals. Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in India before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India. <br> 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word "biryani" is of older usage in India. A similar theory, that biryani came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect, because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.
        <br>According to Pratibha Karan, who wrote the book Biryani, the biryani is of South Indian origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the Indian subcontinent by Arab traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with whichever meat was available. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between "pulao" and "biryani" being arbitrary. According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.

        <strong>2. FRIED CHICKEN</strong>
    </h2>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_chicken" class="Fried Chicken" target="_blank;">
    <img class="image" id="fried" src="https://food.fnr.sndimg.com/content/dam/images/food/fullset/2020/07/14/0/FNK_AIR-FRYER-FRIED-CHICKEN_H-f_s4x3.jpg.rend.hgtvcom.616.493.suffix/1594744001146.jpeg" alt="Fried Chicken" width="500px;"></a>
    <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 13px;">Southern fried chicken, also known simply as fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.
        <br>The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, many West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South.

            <strong>3. ARABIAN MANDI</strong>
        </h2>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandi_(food)" class="Mandi" target="_blank;">
        <img class="image" id="mandi" src="https://imgmedia.lbb.in/media/2019/08/5d48871f8336fa4396163438_1565034271986.jpg" alt="Arabian Mandi" width="500px;"></a>
        <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 13px;">Mandi (Arabic: مندي‎) is a traditional dish that originated from Hadhramaut, Yemen, consisting mainly of meat and rice with a special blend of spices, cooked in a pit underground. It is extremely popular and prevalent in most areas of the Arabian Peninsula, and even considered a staple dish in many regions. It is also found in Egypt, the Levant, and Turkey.
        <br>Mandi is also popular among the Hadhrami people in the Malabar region of Kerala (known as "Kuzhimanthi"), Bhatkal of Karnataka, as well as Barkas and areas around Hyderabad.
        <br>Mandi was usually made from rice, meat (lamb, camel, goat or chicken), and a mixture of spices called hawaij. The meat used is usually a young and small sized lamb to enhance the taste further.
        <br>The main technique which differentiates mandi from other meat dishes is that the meat is cooked in the tandoor (taboon in Arabic), which is a special kind of oven which is usually a pit dug up in the ground and covered with clay all around its sides.
        <br>Mandi is considered the main dish served during special events, such as Eid, weddings, and feasts in Yemen and southern Saudi Arabia.

        <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 13px;">This very fancy Kashmiri pulao, or Kashmiri Pallao, is from the Northern Indian state of Kashmir. Although it is a frozen region high in the Himalayas, Kashmir lies along the ancient overland trade routes between India and Central Asia, and the cuisine is famous for using a huge assortment of nuts and dried fruits from all over Central and Western Asia.</p><hr>

       <img class="image" id="halwa" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DkgeVkaduoI/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Gajar Ka Halwa" width="500px;"></a>
        <p style="font-size: 21px; line-height: 1.5; margin: 13px;">Gajar ka halwa is a combination of nuts, milk, sugar, khoya and ghee with grated carrot. It is a light nutritious dessert with less fat (a minimum of 10.03% and an average of 12.19%) than many other typical sweet from the Indian subcontinent.
